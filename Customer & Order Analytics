#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
